# hello-world

Hello all.
This is Guven. I just start learning coding with python.
I am a mechanical engineer by default and very very interested in 3d printing/scanning. 
I can speak well Turkish, English and some level of Japanese & Dutch. 
I am old enough to remember the floppy dsks, commodore 64, telephones with cables.
